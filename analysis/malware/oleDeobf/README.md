De-obfuscating strings in OLE files

Made for a few specific cases of malware which I decided to attempt automated de-obfuscation.

Currently supports VB Mid() function for substrings and arrays containing obfuscated ascii codes.

The final result currently prints findings, not full solutions.

Adding more in future revisions.
